**Gist**: An annotated bibliography of resources related to programming and transforming business with blockchain solutions.


**Summary**

[INSERT SUMMARY HERE.]

**Tags**

The bibliography is structured in the rough order I read materials. It is curated so that foundational texts and concepts are placed before more challenging reading and materials. The aim is to ensure a gentler slope to the immensely steep learning curves associated with uses and applications of blockchain technology.

Entries in the bibliography are tagged since the bibliography is not organized by category. Tags allow users to quickly search for relevant materials; tags are defined below.
